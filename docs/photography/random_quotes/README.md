# Undertow Eyes

Arguably one of the most famous romances in Brazilian literature, the novel
"Dom Casmurro" coined the "undertow eyes" expression:

> “Lovers' language, give me an exact and poetic comparison to say what those
> eyes of Capitu were like. No image comes to mind that doesn't offend against
> the rules of good style, to say what they were and what they did to me.
> Undertow eyes? Why not? Undertow. That's the notion that the new expression
> put in my head. They held some kind of mysterious, active fluid, a force that
> dragged one in, like the undertow of a wave retreating from the shore on
> stormy days. So as not to be dragged in, I held onto anything around them,
> her ears, her arms, her hair spread about her shoulders; but as soon as I
> returned to the pupils of her eyes again, the wave emerging from them grew
> towards me, deep and dark, threatening to envelop me, draw me in and swallow
> me up.” 

For those who grew up by the ocean, those who have experienced the rage of the
ocean and the force of the undertow, like the Rio de Janeiro born protagonist
in the story, this is a tailor-made way of describing that deep attraction one
feels for a loved one. Once one experiences the metaphorical force the author
describes in that fragment, one can vouch for the accuracy of the comparison:
the ocean can be contained in the eyes of a person.

(Undertow refers to the pull from the ocean towards itself as a wave is
approaching. You're first pulled in, and then when the wave hits you're pushed
out.)

# Love / God of War

When Kratos is trying to overcome the loss of his wife, he dreams about her and
she says:

> The culmination of love is grief, and yet we love despite the inevitable, we
> open our hearts to it. To grieve deeply is to have loved fully.

That moment hits hard when you're playing the game, as you've been in control
of Kratos for a while now and feel very attached to him. This kind of writing
is what I always look for in video games, you don't see it coming, it's
brilliant, it's real outside the game, it affects you in ways that
non-interactive media can't.

This also reminds me of a poem by Vinicius de Moraes -- he is famous for having
written the lyrics of The Girl from Ipanema -- that is also a staple of
Brazilian literature. It is called "Sonnet of Fidelity", and a translation of
the last two verses read:

> And thus, when later comes looking for me
> Who knows, death, anxiety of the living,
> Who knows, loneliness, end of all lovers
> 
> I'll be able to say to myself of the love I had:
> Be not immortal, since it is flame
> But be infinite while it lasts

It is that same idea of love being this feeling you embrace knowing fully well
it will end in a sad way, but that it has to be this way, otherwise it wasn't
really love.

# Pride and Prejudice

While we're talking about love, let's get another one out of the way:

> I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look or the words, which laid
> the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I
> had begun.

That last sentence is what stuck with me, but its context is important: this is
Mr. Darcy pinpointing, or rather failing to, the moment he noticed he was in
love. I suspect this, not being able to tell when it starts, is one of the
hallmarks of love.

# Retellings

>I can't think of a single time where I haven't learned something from you.
>Even if people already know the plot, they appreciate the way you tell the
>story.

This one reminds me of how I enjoy listening to people explain things I
already know, or think I do; very often I end up learning something new or a
new way of looking at the problem. Sometimes the point is in the telling, and
not so much on what's being told.

This is actually a random twitter conversation from a friend [1].

# A Wizard of Earthsea

This is the opening poem of this fantasy story:

> Only in silence the word,
> Only in dark the light,
> Only in dying life:
> Bright the hawk's flight
> On the empty sky.

And, later on, when the main character is dealing with the fallout of their own
poor choices:

> To light a candle is to cast a shadow

I never understood the point of poems before a story starts, but this one
conveys the tone of the story so well it put me in the right mindset from the
start. And these are just such a cool way to express the notion of opposites,
or cause and effect.

# Ghosts of Tsushima

This is what a character says before she goes on a quest for revenge over her
murdered family:

> I've no incense left to burn, I've no prayers left to say.

You know shit is about to get very dark very fast when she says that, and the
game delivers. Simple line, but it pulls the story forward very effectively.

# Mewtwo's famous quote

Most millennials know this one:
 
> I now see that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. It is what
> you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.

Once you grow up, you may have grown bitter at how much the circumstances of
your birth _are_ actually relevant and the world is always reminding you of
this "lottery of life". That said, Mewtwo is talking more about character and
morality, so the quote is still very applicable and very impressive given who
the target audience was.

# Final Fantasy XIV - great boss fight intro

FFXIV is infamous for having a super long story -- hard to get into as a result
-- but with a massive payoff towards the later expansions. Right before
confronting one of the best antagonists I've seen, he says this:

> Weary wonderer, you've no fight left to fight, no life left to live.

That moment was laser cut into my brain because of this sentence. For one
thing, it is an alliteration paradise, but it also captures the essence of
everything that is going on on the story so perfectly.

# Terry Pratchett

The guy is just a master of funny writing and describing the ordinary in an
interesting way. This one comes from the Night Watch book series:

> It was so very early in the morning that ‘late at night’ wasn’t quite over.

I think about it every time I go out super early (~5am) on a Sunday morning in
a big city, where it's possible to see people who clearly have not yet gone to
bed.
