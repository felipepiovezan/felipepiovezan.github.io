title: Japan - July 2025
---

This was my third time travelling to Japan, and this time I decided to try a
different approach: ignore all the major tourist hubs, i.e., Tokyo, Kyoto,
Osaka. Instead, I followed some suggestions from this game called Wagotabi,
which aims to teach you Japanese while having your character travel to lesser
known Japanese cities.

(I love how you know you're going to Japan when you see this note in the bathroom of ANA's economy class).

My first destination was Okayama city, the capital of Okayama prefecture, a
"short" three hour Shinkansen ride south of Tokyo; some may think this would be
undesirable after a long flight, but grab a bento box, some green tea, and this
a great relaxation opportunity.

# Okayama

Okayama is just as big as San Francisco but, by virtue of being off the beaten
path of tourists, it _feels_ empty and peaceful all the time.

![](okayama1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I like this photo because of the context in which it stands. It captures
emptiness in a few different ways: the empty coffee shop, the closed business
besides it, not a soul in the street nor in the apartment above. This is
something I frequently experienced while travelling in smaller cities in Japan,
but the surprising fact is that this was taken at 1pm of a Saturday, during
summer, close to the major attraction of the city.

Kourakuen, one of the great three gardens of Japan, is located just across the
river from where the previous photo was taken. Given how this was peak summer,
no flowers were in full bloom, but it was still a pleasant walk, despite the
heat. Note, again, how empty the place is.

Overlooking the garden is Okayama castle, the other major attraction of the
city. 

![](okayama_castle1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

It has a park around it, a museum inside (mostly in Japanese), though I must
admit it was not very memorable, given how I can't recall much at the time of
writing, six months after the trip. One thing I do remember, because high
school humor is something I haven't fully abandoned, is this sign:

![](bukkake_udon.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

> _Bukkake Udon.
> It is cold udon with Okayama special product. Japanese radish and pickled
> plum, perilla. It is recommended for the prevention of heat stroke._

Alas, it was sold out.

After that, I was finally able to check-in into the hotel, and had the best
time at the onsen -- always book hotels with onsens in Japan, you'll never
regret it. To end the night, I went to an Okonomiyaki restaurant, where I
experienced what would be another theme of this trip: interacting with people a
whole lot more than I'd ever done before while solo travelling.

It was a tiny shop, with three tables shared by all the guests; when I arrived,
only one couple was inside, both were Korean, and it stuck with me the way the
lady shouted "Master!!" when talking to the chef, making me wonder whether she
was translating some expression from Korean. Through the universal language of
a little eye contact and a smile, I invited them to start a conversation. They
told me how they had seen me walk from my hotel all the way to the restaurant,
and how they were impressed that I was travelling alone, with a mandatory
"where is your girlfriend?!" remark. They insisted I should visit Korea now
that I had been to Japan three times, and the woman was very proud about how
her father was an architect who worked on a bridge connecting Seoul airport to
the main land. Soon they started buying me drinks, other locals entered the
shop, and everybody was chatting to each other, making a lot of effort to
communicate in English (I repaid by risking a few sentences in Japanese). It
was a welcoming experience, something that I would get a lot more of later in
the trip and, to me, this where the non touristy areas really shine.

For future reference, the place was called [Sachi Okonomiyaki
Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZ3D4FX4cBFmY2Bz7). Also worth shouting out
this tiny coffee shop: [Coffee stand

# Konpira-san and Marugame

On the next day, I hoped on a JR train and went south, on a scenic route over a
pretty long bridge and lots of rice fields. When taking the JR, it's worth
paying attention to which train cars require seat reservations:

![](train_reservation.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

My first goal was to reach Konpira-san, a Shinto shrine guarded by 785 steps,
plus another 583 to the inner shrine. On the base, you walk through a small
city full of narrow streets and really cute houses.

![](kotohira1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Paths leading to large temples in Japan often have lots of shops, even on a
challenging stairway like this one, adding some entertainment to the visit;
unfortunately, I was a bit too early in this case.

![](konpira_stairs.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

In the main temple area, I just sat and watched the locals for a while, trying
to understand what they were talking about -- I am studying Japanese -- and to
watch how they interact with the temple. There weren't any super scenic spots
there, but a whole lot of everyday things that may sound boring at first,
though they help understand what the local culture really looks like.

I did take one picture of the view at the top, showing how sparsely populated
this area is:

![](konpira_top.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

My second destination that day was Marugame, a city just north of Konpira-san.

![](marugame_station.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The city is pretty famous for its Uchiwa fans (a "hand fan"), and I even got to
watch a local artist make them. Sadly, I was too shy to take a photo --
something I should work on --, having to settle for an advertisement in front
of the tourist center showing what the fans look like:

![](uchiwa.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The other reason to visit Marugame is to visit the eponymous castle, it is one
of few remaining castles with some of its original construction still in place.
Unlike other castles, which have been modernized on the inside, this one is
empty and still has the original wooden floor inside.

![](marugame_castle.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](marugame_castle_inside.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Also, turtles! I swear they must have great eyesight, because they would raise
their heads whenever I looked at them.

![](turtles.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Finally, a visit to this part of Japan demands that you try some of their
peaches, they are delicious, packaged with extreme care, have prices based on a
grading of how good they look, and sold as gifts in train stations, where they
can get pretty expensive. In this stall in Okayama station, a box of three of
the best graded peaches costs ¥4,200! If you pop into a local fruit stall, like
I did in the middle of Marugame, you can find the same for ¥1,000, as long as
you're willing to communicate with the Baa-chan running the shop. The one I
talked to was mighty suspicious of the ¥2,000 bill I handed her, as she had
never seen one before. Another regret was not taking a photo of the local stall
:(.

# Takamatsu

The game I mentioned earlier has your character visiting the city of Takamatsu
and, in the game, the train station has this smiley face in its windows:

![](takamatsu_station_game.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I was surprised to learn it was _not_ an invention from the game, the real
station also looks like that:

![](takamatsu_station_irl.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The main reason to visit Takamatsu is Ritsurin Garden, a massive (750,000 sqm)
garden built in 1745 so that feudal lords could go on a stroll.

known as the "Land of Sunshine", which is an important feature when travelling
in Japan during the rainy season. This
