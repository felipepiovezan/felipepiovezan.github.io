title: Japan - July 2025
---

This was my third time travelling to Japan, and this time I decided to try a
different approach: ignore all the major tourist hubs, i.e., Tokyo, Kyoto,
Osaka. Instead, I followed some suggestions from this game called Wagotabi,
which aims to teach you Japanese while having your character travel to lesser
known Japanese cities.

![](ana_msg.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

(I love how you know you're going to Japan when you see this note in the
bathroom of ANA's economy class).

In case you've never visited Japan, I wanted to share two tips that can make
your travels a lot better:

* Most hotels have coin-operated laundromats; when booking, I highly encourage
you to find those, as it will allow you to travel much lighter. Make sure to
carry some cash for laundry (this is not the only reason to have cash in
Japan).
* Some hotels will have onsens available for free for their guests. If you're
comfortable being naked in front of strangers, I can't recommend those hotels
enough. An onsen after a long day of walking is the best thing ever, just make
sure to read about the etiquette on those.

# Okayama

My first destination was Okayama city, the capital of Okayama prefecture, a
"short" three hour Shinkansen ride south of Tokyo; some may think this would be
undesirable after a long flight, but grab a bento box, some green tea, and this
a great relaxation opportunity.

![](bento.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Okayama is just as big as San Francisco but, by virtue of being off the beaten
path of tourists, it _feels_ empty and peaceful all the time.

![](okayama1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I like this photo because of the context in which it stands. It captures
emptiness in a few different ways: the empty coffee shop, the closed business
besides it, not a soul in the street nor in the apartment above. This is
something I frequently experienced while travelling in smaller cities in Japan,
but the surprising fact is that this was taken at 1pm of a Saturday, during
summer, close to the major attraction of the city.

Kourakuen, one of the great three gardens of Japan, is located just across the
river from where the previous photo was taken. Given how this was peak summer,
no flowers were in full bloom, but it was still a pleasant walk, despite the
heat. Note, again, how empty the place is.

![](kourakuen1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](kourakuen2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](kourakuen3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Overlooking the garden is Okayama castle, the other major attraction of the
city. 

![](okayama_castle1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

It has a park around it, a museum inside (mostly in Japanese), though I must
admit it was not very memorable, given how I can't recall much at the time of
writing, six months after the trip. One thing I do remember, because high
school humor is something I haven't fully abandoned, is this sign:

![](bukkake_udon.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

> _Bukkake Udon.
> It is cold udon with Okayama special product. Japanese radish and pickled
> plum, perilla. It is recommended for the prevention of heat stroke._

Alas, it was sold out.

After that, I was finally able to check-in into the hotel, and had the best
time at the onsen -- always book hotels with onsens in Japan, you'll never
regret it. To end the night, I went to an Okonomiyaki restaurant, where I
experienced what would be another theme of this trip: interacting with people a
whole lot more than I'd ever done before while solo travelling.

It was a tiny shop, with three tables shared by all the guests; when I arrived,
only one couple was inside, both were Korean, and it stuck with me the way the
lady shouted "Master!!" when talking to the chef, making me wonder whether she
was translating some expression from Korean. Through the universal language of
a little eye contact and a smile, I invited them to start a conversation. They
told me how they had seen me walk from my hotel all the way to the restaurant,
and how they were impressed that I was travelling alone, with a mandatory
"where is your girlfriend?!" remark. They insisted I should visit Korea now
that I had been to Japan three times, and the woman was very proud about how
her father was an architect who worked on a bridge connecting Seoul airport to
the main land. Soon they started buying me drinks, other locals entered the
shop, and everybody was chatting to each other, making a lot of effort to
communicate in English (I repaid by risking a few sentences in Japanese). It
was a welcoming experience, something that I would get a lot more of later in
the trip and, to me, this is the kind of thing that gives Japan its welcoming
fame.

![](plum_wine.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

For future reference, the place was called [Sachi Okonomiyaki
Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZ3D4FX4cBFmY2Bz7). Also worth shouting out
this tiny coffee shop: [Coffee stand
887](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vgyUUzogj6dqkwqk9).


# Konpira-san and Marugame

On the next day, I hoped on a JR train and went south, on a scenic route over a
pretty long bridge and lots of rice fields. When taking the JR, it's worth
paying attention to which train cars require seat reservations:

![](train_reservation.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

My first goal was to reach Konpira-san, a Shinto shrine guarded by 785 steps,
plus another 583 to the inner shrine. On the base, you walk through a small
city full of narrow streets and really cute houses.

![](kotohira1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](kotohira2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Paths leading to large temples in Japan often have lots of shops, even on a
challenging stairway like this one, adding some entertainment to the visit;
unfortunately, I was a bit too early in this case.

![](konpira_stairs.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

In the main temple area, I just sat and watched the locals for a while, trying
to understand what they were talking about -- I am studying Japanese -- and to
watch how they interact with the temple. There weren't any super scenic spots
there, but a whole lot of everyday things that may sound boring at first,
though they help understand what the local culture really looks like.

I did take one picture of the view at the top, showing how sparsely populated
this area is:

![](konpira_top.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

My second destination that day was Marugame, a city just north of Konpira-san.

![](marugame_station.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The city is pretty famous for its Uchiwa fans (a "hand fan"), and I even got to
watch a local artist make them. Sadly, I was too shy to take a photo --
something I should work on --, having to settle for an advertisement in front
of the tourist center showing what the fans look like:

![](uchiwa.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The other reason to visit Marugame is to visit the eponymous castle, it is one
of few remaining castles with some of its original construction still in place.
Unlike other castles, which have been modernized on the inside, this one is
empty and still has the original wooden floor inside.

![](marugame_castle.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](marugame_castle_inside.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Also, turtles! I swear they must have great eyesight, because they would raise
their heads whenever I looked at them.

![](turtles.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Finally, a visit to this part of Japan demands that you try some of their
peaches, they are delicious, packaged with extreme care, are graded based on
how good they look, and sold as gifts in train stations, where they can get
pretty expensive. In this stall in Okayama station, a box of three of the best
graded peaches costs ¥4,200! If you pop into a street fruit stall, like I did in
the middle of Marugame, you can find the same for ¥1,000, as long as you're
willing to communicate with the Baa-chan running the shop. The one I talked to
was mighty suspicious of the ¥2,000 bill I handed her, as she had never seen
one before. Another regret was not taking a photo of the stall :(.

![](peaches_on_station.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

# Takamatsu

The game I mentioned earlier has your character visiting the city of Takamatsu
and, in the game, the train station has this smiley face in its windows:

![](takamatsu_station_game.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I was surprised to learn it was _not_ an invention from the game, the real
station also looks like that:

![](takamatsu_station_irl.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The main reason to visit Takamatsu is Ritsurin Garden, a 750,000 sqm (or 18,000
flats in London) garden built in 1745 so that feudal lords could go on a
stroll, and it really seems like the locals use it that way as well. Given how it
is the prettiest garden I've visited in Japan, I couldn't believe how empty
that place was on a weekend, and how quiet and peaceful it gets.

![](ritsurin1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](ritsurin2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](ritsurin3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Also plenty of chances for some nature photography:

![](ritsurin_flower.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](ritsurin_bug.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](ritsurin_leaf.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I then saw a marker called "Takamatsu Castle" on the map and made my way there,
only to find that this is all that remains of the castle:

![](takamatsu_castle.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

In Japan they put a lot of detail into their decoration, for example these
seats overlooking the ocean are shaped like whales:

![](takamatsu_seats.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Now, look again towards the bottom right of that picture, I bet you missed the
creepy old lady staring into your soul.

![](takamatsu_witch.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I was spooked to be sitting there and then find this thing besides me, so I
took the cue and hopped on the next train to Kojima, the "holy land of Jeans".
It is essentially an area where Japanese denim is sold, and all the famous
Japanese jeans brands have stores there.

![](kojima1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](kojima2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The main shopping area is this narrow street whose entrance can be seen in the
picture above. Japan being Japan, they go beyond denim jeans (and beyond denim
clothing) in this area, so you can find all sorts of souvenirs there, my
favourite being this coffee shop that sold coffee bags in a denim bag and also
denim aprons.

![](kojima_coffee.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

// insert photo of coffee bags and apron

I do want to emphasize again that you shouldn't think of this district as a
crowded shopping area, like what you'd see in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, or any big
city; this was a very pleasant shopping experience with very few people around.
Granted, I was there around 3pm, and the stores close at 5pm, but I still can't
imagine this place being crowded.

# Naoshima

The next day I finally left the Okayama area and took a train and a ferry to
Naoshima, one of the art islands of Seto inland sea. Before delving into it, I
wanted to shout out another nice interaction I had with this German couple in
their 50s. They seemed lost in the train station, trying to figure out which
train to take, so I approached them and confirmed they should indeed hop in the
same train that I was about to take: it turned out they were also going to the
Naoshima. Coincidentally, they also took the same ferry that I did, so we
chatted a bunch. Among other things, they talked about how they had lived all
over the world, and the guy mentioned his job was related to politics -- he
didn't seem to want to go into detail, but said he was in Japan mainly for the
Osaka World Expo -- and he was very interested in the fact that I was
considering leaving the US. Fast forward three days, as I am waiting for the
ferry out of the island, and guess who shows up at port? We chat a whole lot
more, exchange our experiences in the island, and travel together all the way
to an intermediate train station, where we part ways. In a brief Sherlock
moment, I realize there aren't many political jobs that will make you live in
lots of countries, so I google "German Consul in \<some-major-city\>" (redacted
for privacy), and the guys photo is the first result on Google.

Anyhow, back to Naoshima!

![](naoshima1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

There are art installations all over the island, and visitors are encouraged to
walk and bike to get to them, so most accommodations will provide free electric
bikes for their guests, along with a helpful map:

![](naoshima_map.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

You really don't need a car here, the bus lines and biking lanes (assuming you
can bike uphill for a bit) are excellent. It is worth taking your time to
explore all the paths in this map, and I found that three nights on the island
provided the perfect amount of time to cover them.

When it comes to the artworks, some can be a bit _too modern_ in my opinion:

![](naoshima_trash.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Some can be a bit too weird: 

![](naoshima_bathtub.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](naoshima_mirror.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

But generally speaking there are lots of cool installations and I found the
process of _discovering_ them while randomly walking/biking through the island
to be very enjoyable, though I am as partial to the ocean as Ishmael from Moby
Dick.

Yayoi Kusama -- she is famous for her pumpkins and her "infinite mirror" works
-- also left some pumpkins there:

![](naoshima_pumpkin.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

(Those glasses are not part of the installation, I think, someone just left
them there and I thought their position would make for a cool shot) 

There is one big hotel on the island, called Benesse House, which also owns
some of the museums and offers free buses between some artworks for guests and
non-guests alike. The hotel has a really nice ocean view, but it is at least
three times as expensive as the other options on the island, I felt much better
off with my room-in-house deal. On the left hand side of this picture, you can
see one of the hotel's guest houses:

![](naoshima_benesse.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

You can also see, two thirds to the right, where the pumpkin from the previous
photo is located. Also on the right hand side of this picture is one of the
spots where you are allowed to swim in the ocean, which proved a blessing in
the peak of Japanese summer, despite bumping into some jelly fish. I still
don't know if they were poisonous.

It's also worth mentioning that the city itself is charming, consisting of lots
of narrow streets and cute traditional Japanese houses. There are some
restaurants in the area, but you really need to make reservations, as most of
them will be tiny and reach capacity early in the evening, making walk-ins
almost impossible. Sadly some of them required at least two people for a
reservation so, fellow solo travellers, make sure you visit one of the two
convenience stores before they close for the day.

![](naoshima_city1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](naoshima_city2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](naoshima_city3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

(Again, notice how empty it is. You can also find me in that last photo!)

The biggest attraction on the island is the Chichu Art Museum. It has a very
strict "no photos allowed" policy, so I can't show you anything about it, but I
will say that it is a physically large museum hosting a very small number of
art pieces over the course of five rooms or so, one per artist, in a very
"minimal and clean" Japanese style. The most famous artist there is Monet, but
the room that blows everyone's mind is by James Turrel; to say what it is would
be to spoil the fun, but suffice it to say that it is worth the visit.

# Nagoya

On the next day I made my way to the one big city of this trip, Nagoya. The
following selfie was taken in July:

![](nagoya_oktober1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Yes, an Oktoberfest in July. I could not believe my ears when I heard the music
from afar and this was pretty legit: German music, people were wearing the
traditional clothing, tents were setup, lots and lots of stalls selling beers
and German food. This was one of the event areas:

![](nagoya_oktober2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

My main goal was to get a haircut. "But what about the language barrier?", you
might ask. Well, I had heard that there was a considerable Brazilian population
in Nagoya, and with some Googling I found a Reddit post with a review for a
barbershop owned by a Brazilian. An Instagram message later, I had an
appointment! The owner was not actually born in Brazil, and he spoke Portuguese
with an accident, but it was enough to help me explain what kind of haircut I
wanted.

The owner told me how, in Japan, barbers have to first undergo an
apprenticeship with a fully licensed barber before they can run their own
business. As such, he explained that his apprentice (who was Japanese) would
wash and dry my hair, and also do a quick back massage (!!). The apprentice
knew a few English sentences, and managed to ask me about soccer -- sadly for
him I am not a soccer guy -- and even pranked me. As he was finishing the back
massage, he got close to my ear and whispered one very vulgar, very Brazilian,
slang for the reproductive female organ. I started laughing out loud so much
the owner asked what was going on, and after some explaining he said
"Portuguese language is part of the apprenticeship".

Nagoya was meant to be a more relaxed part of the trip, so I didn't have much
planned. Instead, I did one of the things I enjoy in big cities (besides trying
food), which is to just follow big roads or crowds and see where those take me.

![](nagoya1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](nagoya2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](nagoya3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Another favourite of mine is to look for views from above, be it hills, or tall
buildings. In this case, I found a high rise that had pretty big glass windows
all around it:

![](nagoya_high1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

It's easier to take photos when there are no windows but, alas, windowless
rooftops are tricky to find (Osaka has one that is perfect for sunsets!).
Nagoya is Japan's fourth biggest city and it certainly looks dense from above:

![](nagoya_high2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](nagoya_high3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The number of train lines coming into Nagoya station is impressive:

![](nagoya_high4.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I was there on July 10th, and was lucky enough that the sunset and moonrise
happened at roughly the same time, though I was unaware of this coincidence at
the time; it was chance that made me look the other way and see an already
risen moon. A few minutes earlier and I would have been able to catch it in an
even "bigger" state.

![](nagoya_moon.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

# Day trip to walk the Nakasendo

During 1600-1800, Japan had five major "highwways", consisting of connected
post towns that facilitated communication. Of these, the Nakasendo connected
Kyoto to Tokyo, and a 10km fragment of it is still preserved in modern day,
allowing you to walk through the Kiso Valley from Magome to Tsumago.

This is a perfect day trip activity from Nagoya, so I took a train plus a bus
to Magome, and started my hike. On the bus, I met a girl from the US who lives
in Rome with her Galician boyfriend; it turned out both of them had a
connection to Brazil, as she had lived there as a journalist and he could,
somehow, speak perfect Brazilian Portuguese due to language evolution making it
similar to Galician. We decided to hike together, which was a nice break from
solo traveling.

You start at a very small town in the middle of a very green valley:

![](nakasendo1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](nakasendo2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The entire way is filled with small gems. For example, this "dead end" sign
that points to the way forward (was it a dead end?):

![](nakasendo3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Or this person who used to maintain a garden along the way (see left sign) but
then became too old to care for it:

![](nakasendo4.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Or this person who sold water-cooled water bottles at an honor system:

![](nakasendo5.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Or this person who maintained a (free) tea room with a chalk board asking
travellers where they came from:

![](nakasendo6.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

During the hike, you're given the chance to take some alternative paths and go,
for example, to a waterfall, but we were a bit concerned with time so we had to
skip it.  Once you complete the walk, you'll be in Tsumago, another very small
town - the kind where locals will greet you as you pass - with some shops and
one coffee shop. Most people will then take a bus to Nagiso, where the closest
train station is, but we opted out to walk there.

In Nagiso, we were lucky to encounter the most helpful staff at the train
station. My hiking companions had pre-booked train tickets using some website
(you really don't need to do this when taking JR trains), which meant that they
had to find a ticket machine capable of scanning QR codes, a problem in the
smaller train stations. They won't have any ticket machines at all. We talked
to the lady working on the ticket gate, and she did a _lot_ of research to
figure out which kinds of trains we could take with the ticket type my friends
had bought, wrote down the schedule for them, and explained in detailed
everything they needed to do. All this effort while speaking English as best as
she could. We had an hour until the next train, so we went out for coffee and,
when we returned to the station, the helpful lady ran towards us because she
had found a better way of doing things; she had clearly spent the hour trying
to this problem.

# Atami

My next destination was Atami, a beach town just south of Tokyo. When I say
beach town, it's important to keep expectations in check, as this is what the
beach looks like:

![](atami_beach.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

There is considerably more space when the tide is low, and this area gets very
crowded on a sunny weekend with people from Tokyo coming on a day trip. That
said, the weather while I was there was not very helpful, as we were
experiencing the effects of a nearby hurricane. Thankfully the hotel I stayed
at had an onsen with great views, and it even had one at an open area of the
rooftop.

They also take their tsunami warnings very seriously, with signs and sirens everywhere:

![](atami_tsunami2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](atami_tsunami1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

As I was walking the mostly empty streets on my first evening, I heard some
drums and music and decided to follow them to the source. It turned out to be
this float-like structure:

![](atami_float.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I didn't make much of it at the time, but on the following night it became
clear: there was a local festival going on, where each neighborhood (or
school?) in Atami had its own float, decorated under a chosen theme, and all
the participants were signing and playing drums while they paraded on the main
street of the city, stopping in front of a booth of judges for evaluation.

![](atami_float1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](atami_float2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](atami_float3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](atami_float4.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](atami_float5.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I believe the local temples were also participating with groups carrying a
small temple on their shoulders, while singing and walking (more like dancing,
really) in a very peculiar way, bending their legs in an exaggerated manner
with each step.

![](atami_temple_float1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](atami_temple_float2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

It was also a bit of a street party, lots of people were just having fun in
kimonos and costumes. I wish I had chosen a better shutter speed for this pair
of photos:

![](atami_street_party1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](atami_street_party2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

These local festivals in Japan are always a treat, it's always worth looking
out for them whenever you plan a trip.

My time in Atami was pretty chill otherwise, in one of the days I went to Tokyo
to meet a friend, and it very rainy in the other, so I just went to a local
museum and visited shops.


# Oshima

My next destination required taking a high speed ferry to the nearby island of
Oshima, and this ferry can get cancelled due to weather conditions. June is
infamous for being the typhoon season. In fact, the rain I mentioned before was
caused by a typhoon passing by, and it did cause cancellations on those days.
There is a website you have to check at 6am of the day of departure, where they
communicate whether the ferry will depart or not; thankfully, I dodged the
typhoon by a day.

As I arrived at the port to catch the ferry, I was greeted by an old Japanese
man playing a Sanshin (three-cord Okinawan guitar). He asked me where I was
going, helped me find the ticket counter but told me it was not yet open, so he
waited with me. He spoke very good English, and told me he used to be a
business man, now retired, who had lived in Canada and a few other places. In
his mornings, he enjoys playing the Sanshin by the pier and, in the afternoon,
he works as a translator for a chef who runs cooking workshops in the city.
When I tell him I am Brazilian, he surprises me by speaking Portuguese! One of
those "other places" he had lived was Brazil, and he had backpacked in South
America in his youth, including through my home town. 

![](ferry_friend1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I was also greeted by this other extremely cute friend:

![](ferry_friend2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

Look at how the hat fits his ears!

![](ferry_friend3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

So cute.

Oshima is a small island with am active volcano at its center, which had a
major eruption in 1986 and a minor one in 1990. Knowing this, it made me
appreciate everything around me even more, and somehow it gave me a sense of
foreboding, a sense that nothing is to be taken for granted, but also a
peaceful feeling at the same time. It is hard to describe it.

This is once again a place where a bike is necessary, and there are plenty of
rentals on the island. I got one and went around the coast on my own, and
quickly found myself alone in this insane mix of deep blue, green, and black.

![](ooshima1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](ooshima2.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

![](ooshima3.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

I must have biked for a solid fifteen minutes before I saw another soul around
me; there were quite a few rest places along the way, and yet no one was using
them.

There are stairs leading down to the shore where you can walk on volcanic rock:

![](ooshima_volcanic_rock.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

They also employ these massive star-shaped concrete blocks around the coast,
presumably to help with tsunamis somehow?

![](ooshima_concrete.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}
