title: Japan - July 2025
---

This was my third time travelling to Japan, and this time I decided to try a
different approach: ignore all the major tourist hubs, i.e., Tokyo, Kyoto,
Osaka. Instead, I followed some suggestions from this game called Wagotabi,
which aims to teach you Japanese while having your character travel to lesser
known Japanese cities.

(I love how you know you're going to Japan when you see this note in the bathroom of ANA's economy class).

My first destination was Okayama city, the capital of Okayama prefecture, a
"short" three hour Shinkansen ride south of Tokyo; some may think this would be
undesirable after a long flight, but grab a bento box, some green tea, and this
a great relaxation opportunity.

# Okayama

Okayama is just as big as San Francisco but, by virtue of being off the beaten
path of tourists, it _feels_ empty and peaceful all the time.

I like this photo because of the context in which it stands. It captures
emptiness in a few different ways: the empty coffee shop, the closed business
besides it, not a soul in the street nor in the apartment above. This is
something I frequently experienced while travelling in smaller cities in Japan,
but the surprising fact is that this was taken at 1pm of a Saturday, during
summer, close to the major attraction of the city.

Kourakuen, one of the great three gardens of Japan, is located just across the
river from where the previous photo was taken. Given how this was peak summer,
no flowers were in full bloom, but it was still a pleasant walk, despite the
heat. Note, again, how empty the place is.

Overlooking the garden, sits Okayama castle, the other major attraction of the
city. 

![](okayama_castle1.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

It has a park around it, a museum inside (mostly in Japanese), though I must
admit it was not very memorable, given how I can't recall much at the time of
writing, six months after the trip. As high school humor is something I haven't
fully abandoned, this sign stuck with me:

![](bukkake_udon.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

> Bukkake Udon.
> It is cold udon with Okayama special product. Japanese radish and pickled
> plum, perilla. It is recommended for the prevention of heat stroke.

Alas, it was sold out.

After that, I was finally able to check-in into the hotel, and had the best
time at the onsen -- always book hotels with onsens in Japan, you'll never
regret it. To end the night, I went to an Okonomiyaki restaurant, where I
experienced what would be another theme of this trip: interacting with people a
whole lot more than I'd ever done before while solo travelling.

It was a tiny shop, with three tables shared by all the guests; when I arrived,
only one couple was inside -- they had just arrived --, both were Korean and
started a conversation with me. Through very basic English, they told me how
they had seen me walk from my hotel all the way to the restaurant, and how they
were impressed that I was travelling alone, with a mandatory "where is your
girlfriend?!" remark. They insisted I should visit Korea now that I had been to
Japan three times, and the woman was very proud about how her father was an
architect who worked on a bridge connecting Seoul airport to the main land.
Soon they started buying me drinks, other locals entered the shop, and
everybody was chatting. It was a welcoming experience, something that I could
get a lot more of later in the trip and, to me, this where the non touristy
areas really shine.

For future reference, the place was called [Sachi Okonomiyaki
Restaurant](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SZ3D4FX4cBFmY2Bz7). Also worth shouting out
this tiny coffee shop: [Coffee stand
887](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vgyUUzogj6dqkwqk9).


# Konpira-san and Marugame

On the next day, I hoped on a JR train and went south, on a scenic route over a
pretty long bridge and lots of rice fields. When taking the JR, it's worth paying attention to which train cars require seat reservations:

![](train_reservation.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

My first goal was to reach Konpira-san, a Shinto shrine guarded by 785 steps,
plus another 583 to the inner shrine. On the base, you walk through a small city filled with narrow streets and really cute houses.

Paths leading to large temples in Japan often have lots of shops, even on a challenging stairway like this one, making the visit a lot more entertaining; unfortunately, I was a bit too early in this case.

![](konpira_stairs.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

In the main temple area, I just sat and watched the locals for a while, trying
to understand what they were talking about -- I am studying Japanese -- and
just to see how they interact with the temple. When one visits less touristy
areas, one won't find popular picture spots; instead, there are lot of everyday
things that may sound boring at first, but those reveal what the local culture
really looks like.

Out of respect, I avoid taking pictures in temples unless they encourage it,
but I did take one from the view at the top, showing how sparsely populated
this area is:

My second destination that day was Marugame, a city just north of Konpira-san.

![](marugame_stations.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The city is pretty famous for its Uchiwa fans (a "hand fan"), and I even got to
watch a local artist make them. Sadly, I was too shy to take a photo --
something I should work on --, so here's a photo of an advertisement in front
of the tourist center, showing what the fans look like:

![](uchiwa.heic){style="display:block; margin: auto;"}

The other reason to visit Marugame is to visit the eponymous castle, it is one
of few remaining castles with some of its original construction still in place.
Unlike other castles, which have been modernized on the inside, this one is
empty and still has the original wooden floor inside, you have to wear special
shoes inside.

Also, turtles!

Finally, a visit to this part of Japan demands that you try some of their
peaches. They are delicious, packaged with extreme care, have prices based
on a grading of how good they look, and sold at most train stations as one of
the many gifts travellers can purchase. However, they can get pretty expensive at those locations, see this photo taken back in Okayama station:

known as the "Land of Sunshine", which is an important feature when travelling
in Japan during the rainy season. This
